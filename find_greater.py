"""
Write a Python program that uses a function find_greater(values: list[int],
target: int) -> int to determine the number of values in a list of integers that
are greater than a value specified by the user. The function will take as a
parameter a list of integers and a single int provided by the user. It will
return the number of values in the list that exceed the user's target number.

Your main function will test your function implementation by calling
`find_greater` at least five times with arguments to exercise different test cases.
